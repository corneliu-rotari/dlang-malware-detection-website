In case an error occurs we throw a new HTTPExeception based on which scenario it occurs.
If the request response from the database is succesfull we return HTTPStatus.ok.

## 1. User Management
1. addUser()
    - Check if password and email is valid
    - Check if user exists
    - Return okay
